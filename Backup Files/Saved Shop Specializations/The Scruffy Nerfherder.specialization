<html><b>The Scruffy Nerfherder
<html>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As you enter the Scruffy Nerfherder, you see an old Twi'lek standing behind the bar using a crusty-looking rag to polish an increasingly dirty glass. Next to the bar are two stages (which are clearly just tables pushed up against the wall with gaudy lighting overhead). Atop the tables, several more Twi'leks are dancing to the too-loud house music.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bartender greets you as you approach.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "What's your poison?"</html>
